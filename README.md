# GSoC-2020
## Swift library for Image Loading

### MILESTONE 1: 
Benchmark the image loading libraries using subset of imagenette to figure out the fastest and the most stable library.

1. For Benchmarking, we used: https://github.com/google/swift-benchmark  
2. For Image Dataset, we used: https://github.com/fastai/imagenette  
  Created a random subset of 1000 images by selecting 100 images from each class (10 classes) to have a balanced dataset.
